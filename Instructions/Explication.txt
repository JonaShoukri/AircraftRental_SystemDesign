airplane is a complexe object. imagine and add  helicopter as another complex object.
create 3 model for each. use factory to order complex object from builderS which gather 
small objects from other factories.
Abstract Factory -> Builders -> Factories.

how about state design pattern? can integrate it in this project?
or observer design pattern?..

be creative !
